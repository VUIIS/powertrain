Welcome to Powertrain's documentation!
======================================

Powertrain is not a new idea. Many groups around the world are attempting to create scalable systems for large-scale medical image processing. In this respect, Powertrain is simply yet another attempt at building such a system.

Powertrain relies on three separate systems:

* `REDCap <http://project-redcap.org>`_, the web-based data-capture system from Vanderbilt.
* `XNAT <http://xnat.org>`_, eXtensible Neuroimaging Archive Tool from WUSTL.
* `ACCRE <http://accre.vanderbilt.edu>`_, Vanderbilt's compute cluster.
